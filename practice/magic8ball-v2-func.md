# Practice: Magic 8 Ball Version 2 - functions

Make a program that asks a user their name and returns a randomly chosen "fortune" response from the "magic 8 ball". Make 9 different possible "fortunes".

Use functions with a main() function. You can refactor your previous Magic 8 ball
program or write a new one from scratch.

Save your program as 'magic8ball-func.py'
